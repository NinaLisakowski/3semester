# 3semester


None of the exercies have test made to them. This is because the teacher said that they are not required just yet.

28-1-2020 Here the two projects point and customer from JPA-intro-day2-exercises are found.
* The customerexercise also shows a part of the exercise that was made on wednesday the 29-1-2020, the endpoint-part.

29-1-2020 Here rest1 is found from REST-intro-day3-exercises. It is the assignment with animals.

30-1-2020 The assignment from from JPA-intro-day4-exercises is found here.
* Here is the link to the droplet http://142.93.171.214:8080/jpa_rest_startup-1.0/ 
* The link does not work because the only databse connected is a local one.

31-1-2020 Has the exercise from JPA, REST and DTOs, it is called jpa_rest_startup.
* Here is the link to the droplet http://142.93.171.214:8080/jpa_rest_startup-1.0/api/bankcustomer/
* Endpoints to be used here are api/bankcustomer/populate, api/bankcustomer/id/{id}, and api/bankcustomer/getAll
* I have had a lot of problems with the endpoints, it them not working at all and giving an HTTP 500 servlet exception. At the end i startet working when I moved the files into a completely new project.
* The /populate endpoint should run first to put some pre-made data into the database.
